                <h6>Coverage and scope</h6>
                <p>The refund policy terms and conditions govern how Obscorn and/or its website handle refunds. This refund policy is not applicable to the practices of organizations that Obscorn does not own or regulate, or to individuals that Obscorn does not hire or oversee, including any third-party service and/or product suppliers bound by contract, as well as any third-party websites linked from Obscorn's website.
                </p>
                <h6>Filing a complaint</h6>
                <p>Obscorn thinks that every effort begins with an end goal in mind. As a result, in the event of a dissatisfying service, all feasible attempts to reach an amicable agreement on a solution should be given precedence. Refunds are a last resort that might be used when things are simply not working out. Our ultimate objective is to establish a mutually satisfying solution. If you are dissatisfied for any reason and are considering making a refund claim, please take a few minutes to contact us at dispute (@) Obscorn.ae to start a conversation before demanding a refund. Refund claims should be submitted only if we are unable to reach an agreement.</p>

                <h6>Eligible for refund</h6>
                <p>Obscorn takes every project seriously and guarantees that it is handled professionally and that the customer receives the results specified in the proposal. However, if the customer is dissatisfied with the decision and has completed the dispute resolution procedure, we will evaluate refund requests in accordance with the schedule below, which clearly identifies the services and our refund policy for each service.</p>
                <h6>Application programming</h6>
                <p>If the job has not yet begun, we will provide a full refund. Every application development project requires its own agreement. If there is no agreement and clear mention of a return policy, the following delivery policy shall apply.
                </p>
                <p>If the project is not finished in accordance with the delivery policy and agreed-upon contract, the service provider may provide a partial refund at their discretion. This will be computed based on the proportion of the project finished by Obscorn and the percentage that remains to be finished according to the project's predefined scope.
                </p>

                <h6>Dedicated hiring</h6>
                <p>If the developer, graphic designer, content writer, SEO specialist, or any other staff member has not begun the project, there will be a full refund. If the client opts to abandon the purchase at any time, he or she will get a partial refund. No refunds will be issued for days when the resource has already functioned. If the client is dissatisfied with the work at any time, he must immediately tell our Project Manager and request commitments to discounts for job loss. Any such negotiations at a later date will be unacceptable.</p>

                <h6>Applicability of delivery policy</h6>
                <p>Please take notice that Obscorn's delivery pledge is subject to: Timely payments: A project is not declared invalid if the agreed-upon / stated payments are unclear. Timely communication from the client: Obscorn is not obligated to follow the Refund Policy if the necessary information for effective project completion is not supplied to us in a timely way. Obscorn is not responsible for any project delays or failures caused by such events. Completeness of client-provided information: If the information supplied to Obscorn is incomplete, and/or the whole information/scope of the project isn't given at the start of the project, Obscorn is not obligated to keep its delivery and/or refund promises. Obscorn will not compensate you for delivery delays under any circumstances, unless a particular agreement is formed with a penalty provision.</p>
                <h6>Limitation of liability</h6>
                <p>Obscorn's liability is limited to the value of the portion of the project (as specified in the Obscorn proposal) that is unfinished at any given moment. Obscorn cannot be held liable for any losses incurred as a result of services given or not delivered, or delays in the same. The responsibility to reimburse arises only if the customer cancels the project and communicates such cancellation to Obscorn in writing.</p>

                <h6>Processing of refunds</h6>
                <p>Refunds will be handled and delivered within 5 business days after the termination date, utilizing the same form of payment as the original (check or credit card).
